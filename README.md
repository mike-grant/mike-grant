# Hey, I'm Mike 👋

UK-based developer building SaaS products and open source tools, mostly AI-powered. I used to write C# and ship Xamarin apps — now I ship Next.js and let agents do the boring parts.

**TypeScript · Next.js · Python · AI/LLMs · Cloudflare Workers**

## 🚀 What I'm building

**[ReverseHolo](https://reverseholo.app)** — Pokemon TCG collection tracker. Manage your binders, track set completion, and monitor card prices. Three modes: Collector, Trader, Investor.

**[Scrapezy](https://scrapezy.com)** — AI web scraping as a service. Point it at a page, describe what you want, get structured data back. Includes a Chrome extension and an MCP server so your AI assistant can scrape the web directly.

**[UIDirector](https://uidirector.com)** — Turn any website into a `design.json` your AI coding tools can actually use. Works great with Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code.

**[Spectrae](https://spectrae.dev)** — Browser as a service. Headless Chrome on demand for scraping, testing, and automation without managing your own infrastructure.

**[claude-code-history](https://github.com/mike-grant/claude-code-history)** — CLI to search your Claude Code conversation history. Fast standalone binary, regex support, date filtering. Install via Homebrew.

```bash
brew install mike-grant/tap/claude-code-history
```
